Purchasing strategies are a significant contributing factor to the overall performance of a firm. Not only has it been argued that transitioning purchasing from a tactical to a strategic role provides sustainable competitive advantage, compelling evidence supports the relationship between strategic purchasing and supplier integration, performance, power, and total cost of ownership among other benefits. Consequently, it has become widely accepted that establishing a strategic purchasing approach is imperative for today’s firm. 

Towards this goal, the most established portfolio model in literature and practice is Kraljic’s model[^kraljic] known as the Kraljic Portfolio Matrix (KPM). However, one of the primary weaknesses of the KPM is the qualitative nature of the model, which results in a subjective method for weighting and positioning suppliers or commodities in the quadrants of the KPM. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the `kraljicMatrix` package can be used as a quantitative framework to objectively position purchases in the KPM matrix along with identifying which products and services to begin strategic sourcing efforts with.

# The Kraljic Portfolio Matrix

Kraljic (1983) introduced the first comprehensive portfolio approach for purchasing and supply management.  Although other models have been developed, Kraljic’s KPM approach has become the dominant methodology built upon in literature and the foundation for purchasing strategies for many organizations. Kraljic’s approach leverages a portfolio matrix that classifies products on the basis of two dimensions: the external dimension (‘Supply Risk’) concerns the factors regarding suppliers and supply market, while the internal dimension (‘Profit Impact’) relates to the importance and profit impact of a given product. Each dimension needs to be assessed against a number of variables where an overall classification score (‘low’ and ‘high’) is established. The result is a  matrix and a classification in four categories: non-critical, leverage, bottleneck, and strategic items as illustrated in Figure 1. This categorization allows commodities to be classified in a way that minimizes the supply risk while maximizing purchasing power and profits of the firm.
