# Summary

`KraljicMatrix` is an R package (@R) that implements a quantified approach to the Kraljic Matrix (@kraljic) introduced by Montgomery et al. (@quantKraljic). It allows a firm to strategically analyze its purchasing portfolio with single- and multi-attribute value analysis to measure purchasing characteristics. In addition `KraljicMatrix` also provides useful functions to identify the preferred single utility slope based on subject matter expert inputs, assign and place purchases within the Kraljic Matrix, and perform sensitivity analysis.

The following is an example visualization made using `KraljicMatrix`'s analysis tools.
